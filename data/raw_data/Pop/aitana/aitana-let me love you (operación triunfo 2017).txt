I used to believe
We were burning on the edge of something beautiful
Something beautiful
Selling a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle
On a miracle

Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me love you

Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me love you

Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
Know we're good enough

Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let you down

Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me love you

Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me love you

Never let you go
Never let you go, no
Never let you go
Never let you go, no
Never let you go
Never let you go

Don't you give up
Don't you give up
I won't give up
I won't
Let me love you
Let me love you

I won't give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
