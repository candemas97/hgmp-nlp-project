Dance, dance, dance
Rock, rock, rock
Roll, roll, roll
Contigo, cariño mío

Did I tell you how I like it?
I like everything about it
Baby, what a blessing
I've been dancing for a decade
Fell in love with it the first date
Baby, there's no guessing

Cómo bailas y cómo cantas
Collaboration
Body and soul, girl, it's all about
The pure love we have inside

So dance, dance, dance (oh)
Baby, rock, rock, rock (oh)
Let's roll, roll, roll (oh)
Contigo, cariño mío
I love to dance, dance, dance (oh)
I love to rock, rock, rock (oh)
I love to roll, roll, roll (oh)
Contigo, cariño mío

You make me wanna salsa, salsa
You make me wanna cha-cha
Slow down, get up and down
Mueve la cintura, turn it around

If I tell you that I'm feeling
The same way, it's like a healing
Baby, you're a blessing
The steps became like my heart beat
I feel alive working my feet
Baby, it's impressing

Cómo bailas y cómo cantas
Collaboration
Body and soul, boy, it's all about
The love that we have inside

So dance, dance, dance (oh)
Baby, rock, rock, rock (oh)
Let's roll, roll, roll (oh)
Contigo, cariño mío
I love to dance, dance, dance (oh)
I love to rock, rock, rock (oh)
I love to roll, roll, roll (oh)
Contigo, cariño mío

You make me wanna salsa
You make me wanna cha-cha
Slow down, get up and down
Mueve la cintura turn it around

You make me wanna salsa
You make me wanna cha-cha (you make me)
Slow down, get up and down
Mueve la cintura, turn it around

So dance, dance, dance (oh)
Baby, rock, rock, rock (oh) (yeah-yeah)
Let's roll, roll, roll (oh)
Contigo, cariño mío
I love to dance, dance, dance (oh) (dance, dance, come along)
