Mi amor, I'm not sure of the right words to say
Maybe these simple words will do best to best explain
What I feel in my heart, what I feel more each day, oh
How to make you see, how to let you know
How to say, how to say how I love you so

With words you understand
Words that get right through to your heart
Here's the place to start

Tu amor (tu amor)
I will always be
Tu amor (tu amor)
Means the world to me
Estarás siempre en mi corazón
You're the one in my soul
And I live for tu amor (tu amor)
Tu amor

Mi amor, love you more with each look in your eyes
Maybe these simple words will do best to best describe
What I feel in my heart, what I'll feel for all time, oh
How to make you see, how to let you know
How to see, how to say how I need you so

With words you understand
Words that get right through to your soul
Words that let you know

Tu amor (tu amor)
I will always be
Tu amor (tu amor)
Means the world to me
Estarás siempre en mi corazón
You're the one in my soul
And I live for tu amor (tu amor)

You're the one that I need in my arms
Believe me these words I say
Are words that come straight from my heart
How do I make you believe?
Nothing else means as much as what you mean to me

Tú eres la única en mi alma
Tú eres el único en mi alma
Yo te quiero (yo te quiero)
Te adoro (te adoro)
Tus labios (tus labios)
