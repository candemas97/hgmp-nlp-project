I remember when I met you
I didn't wanna fall
I felt my hands were shaking
'Cause you looked so beautiful

I remember when you kissed me
I knew you were the one
Oh, my hands were shaking
When you played my favorite song

I don't know why
But every time I look into your eyes
I see a thousand fallin' shooting stars
And yes, I love you
I can't believe that every night you're by my side

Promise I'll stay here till the morning
And pick you up when you're falling
When the rain gets rough, when you've had enough
I'll just sweep you off your feet
And fix you with my love

My only one
My only one

Tell me how you do it
I can barely breathe
With a smile, you get, you get the best of me
And all I really want is to give you all of me

Tell me how you do it
How you bring me back
You bring me back to life
Then make my heartbeat stop
I can't take it

I don't know why
Buy every time I look into your eyes
I see a thousand fallin' shooting stars
And yes, I love you
I can't believe that every night you're by my side

Voy a cuidarte por las noches
Voy a amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extra√±ar en la tempestad
Y aunque existan mil razones para renunciar

Promise I'll stay here till the morning
And pick you up when you're falling
When the rain gets rough, when you've had enough
I'll just sweep you off your feet
And fix you with my love

My only one
(There's no one else)
My only one
(There's no one else)
You are my only one
(It's just there's no one else)
My only one

My only
