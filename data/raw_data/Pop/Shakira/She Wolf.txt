SOS, she's in disguise
SOS, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The Moon's awake now with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (ah)
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy
To get me a lover and tell you about it

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (a-ooh)
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The Moon's my teacher and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys, I just want to enjoy (ah)
By having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (a-ooh)
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

SOS, she's in disguise
SOS, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

SOS, she's in disguise
SOS, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

There's a she wolf in the closet
Let it out so it can breathe
