Mantronik stop flipping already and pump up the music now, ha ha ha

I tried to tell you boy
It can't be tonight it just isn't right
You've got to understand
When there's hesitation you've got to be patient

It's not to win or lose it's how you play
You've got to find a way to make me stay
Oh can't you see we're losing ground
You better slow it down or walk away

I'm not giving you my heart, right from the start
I got to know your not learning to love from me
I got no secrets in the dark, right from the start
I got to know you'll stay

Just 'cause I wanted you
Don't take advantage, don't take me for granted
I need much more than this
Kind affection, need some real attention

It's not to win or lose it's how you play
You've got to find a way to make me stay
Oh can't you see we're losing ground
You better slow it down or walk away

I'm not giving you my heart, right from the start
I got to know your not learning to love from me
I got no secrets in the dark, right from the start
I got to know you'll stay
I'm not giving you my heart, right from the start
I got to know your not learning to love from me
I got no secrets in the dark, right from the start
I got to know you'll stay

It's not to win or lose it's how you play
You've got to find a way to make me stay
Oh can't you see we're losing ground
You better slow it down or walk away

I'm not giving you my heart, right from the start
I got to know your not learning to love from me
I got no secrets in the dark, right from the start
I got to know you'll stay
I'm not giving you my heart, right from the start
I got to know your not learning to love from me
I got no secrets in the dark, right from the start
I got to know you'll stay
