As I look into your eyes
I see all the reasons why
My life's worth a thousand skies
You're the simplest love I've known
and the purest one I'll own
no you'll never be alone

(Chorus)
My baby you
Are the reason I could fly
And cause of you
I don't have to wonder why
Baby you
There's no more just getting by
You're the reason I feel so alive

Though these words I sing are true
They still fail to capture you
As mere words can only do
How do I explain that smile
And how it turns my world around
Keeping my feet on the ground

(Chorus)
My baby you
Are the reason I could fly
And cause of you
I don't have to wonder why
Baby you
There's no more just getting by
You're the reason I feel so alive

I will soothe you if you fall
I'll be right there if you call
You're my greatest love of all

(Chorus)
You are the reason I could fly
And cause of you
I don't have to wonder why
My baby you
There's no more just getting by
You're the reason I feel so alive

Arianna, I feel so alive
