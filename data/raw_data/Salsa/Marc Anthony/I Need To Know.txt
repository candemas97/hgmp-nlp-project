They say around the way you've asked for me
There's even talk about you wanting me
I must admit that's what I wanna hear
But that's just talk until you take me there

Oh, if it's true don't leave me all alone out here
Wondering if you're ever going to take me there
Tell me what you're feeling 'cause I need to know
Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go

'Cause I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know

My every thought is of this being true
It's getting harder not to think of you
Girl, I'm exactly where I want to be
The only things I need you here with me

Oh, if it's true don't leave me all alone out here
Wondering if you're ever going to take me there
Tell me what you're feeling 'cause I need to know
Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go

'Cause I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know
