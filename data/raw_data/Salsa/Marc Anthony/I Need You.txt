From the day that I met you, girl
I knew that your love would be
Everything that I ever wanted in my life
From the moment you spoke my name
I knew everything had changed
Because of you I felt my life would be complete

Oh baby I need you
For the rest of my life
Girl I need you (I really need, nobody but you)
To make everything right
Girl, I love you
And I'll never deny that
I need you (I really need, nobody but you)

Nothing matters but you my love
And only God above
Could be the one to know exactly how I feel
I could die in your arms right now
Knowing that you, somehow,
Would take my soul and keep it deep inside your heart

Oh baby I need you
For the rest of my life
Girl I need you (I really need, nobody but you)
To make everything right
Girl, I love you
And I'll never deny that
I need you (I really need, nobody but you)

Girl, your love to me feels just like magic
When you smile, you have total control
You have power like nothing I've felt before
I've let all of my feelings show
Cause I want you to know that
I need you (I really need, nobody but you)

I need you
For the rest of my life
Girl I need you (I really need, nobody but you)
Say that you'll be my wife
Oh I... love you
Won't you marry me, marry me
I need you (I really need, nobody but you)

Oh I need you
For the rest of my life
Oh I... need you (I really need, nobody but you)
Won't you marry me, marry me
I love you
I really need, baby
I need you (I really need, nobody but you)

Girl you really need
I need you
Girl you really need
I need you
Need you (I really need, nobody but you)
Ohh baby
I love you
I need you (I really need, nobody but you)

Girl I really need you
Need your love
Oh baby
Won't you marry me (I really need, nobody but you)
Won't you marry me, marry me
I love you
Ohhh
I need you! (I really need, nobody but you)
