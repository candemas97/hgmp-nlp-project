One life, one dream
One moment, one team
One youth, lights high
Thousand road blocks, one shot
One truth, no fears
One flag, oh yeah
We've been waiting for this all year
Where y'all at? We're right here!

Ya empezó la rumba y estamos celebrando
Todo el mundo que me levante la mano
'Tamos vivos, hay que disfrutarlo
Hoy nadie me detiene porque yo no sé parar, no, no

One life, live it up, 'cause we got one life
One life, live it up, 'cause we got one life
One life, live it up, 'cause you don't get it twice
One life, live it up, 'cause you don't get it twice

For the love
I'm a rebel, I'm coming from
Every nation under the sun
Elevating their favorite song when we hit and run
You wanted it, you got it
The whole world is watching
So let's get this pumping
Where y'all at? We're right there!

[Nicky Jam]
Only one life to live, got so much to give
Fighting for the nation now, that is my gift
Run like a champion and win like a king
That's my only goal, my everything
Live it up now, now

Oh oh, oh oh oh oh (victories, celebration)
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh (one love, one nation)

That's freedom when you reach that goal
