I have been in love
And been alone
I have traveled over many miles
To find a home
There's that little place
Inside of me
That I never thought could
Take control of everything
But now I just spend all my time
With anyone
Who makes me feel
The way she does

Chorus:
'Cause I only feel alive
When I dream at night
Even though she's not real
It's all right
'Cause I only feel alive
When I dream at night
Every move that she makes
Holds my eyes
And I fall for her every time

I've so many things I want to say
I'll be ready when
The perfect moment
Comes my way
I had never known
What's right for me
'Til the night
She opened up my heart
And set it free
But now I just spend all my time
With anyone
Who makes me feel
The way she does

Chorus:
'Cause I only feel alive
When I dream at night
Even though she's not real
It's all right
'Cause I only feel alive
When I dream at night
Every move that she makes
Holds my eyes
And I fall for her every time

Now I just spend all my time
With anyone
Who makes me feel
The way she does

'Cause I only feel alive
When I dream at night
Even though she's not real
It's all right
'Cause I only feel alive
When I dream at night
Every move that she makes
Holds my eyes
And I fall for her every time
