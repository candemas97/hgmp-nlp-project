It was a Thursday
And the first day I saw you
Never really thought
That you would be the one
To make the sky turn blue

It was amazing
The way that you captured me
It took my heart
And made me feel that we can be so easily

How enchanting, as we're dancing
My life began to change
I don't knew what took control
But all that I could say was

Era la música
That made me run to you
Era la música
That made my dreams come true
Era la música
As we danced the night away
Era la música
That made me love you

So exciting
How did I find someone like you?
Someone to make me feel
That love was reallly oh so true

It was incredible
The way that this came to be
He took my hand and then began
To take a hold of me

How enchanting, as we're dancing
My life began to change
I don't knew what took control
But all that I could say was

Era la música
That made me run to you
Era la música
That made my dreams come true
Era la música
As we danced the night away
Era la música
That made me love you

It was the music that made me love you
The way you move takes my breath away
The way you dance, girl is like no other
Was it the music that made you stay?

Stay with me girl I'll show you
Where we could go
Far away to a place
Only love goes

Yo no sé lo que me está pasando
A ti te sigo amando

How enchanting, as we're dancing
My life began to change
I don't know what took control
But all that I could say was

Era la música
That made me run to you
Era la música
That made my dreams come true
Era la música
As we danced the night away
Era la música
That made me love you

Era la música
That made me run to you
Era la música
That made my dreams come true
Era la música
As we danced the night away
Era la música
That made me love you
