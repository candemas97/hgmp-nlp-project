The rain (the rain)

It's not enough to be the one who holds you
It's not enough to be the one you're close to
I want to be so much more
The love that you're living for
The air you breathe
I wanna be everything that touches you, everything

I wanna be the rain
That falls on you
Washes away the pain
I wanna be the Sun
That shines on you
Warms your world each day
I wanna be the sky that holds the stars for you
So you never lose your way
I wanna be the wind that kisses your face
I wanna be the rain

It's not enough for me to be around you
I wanna be everything that surrounds you
The sunlight upon your skin
Each breath that you're breathing
All that you need
I wanna be everything that touches you, everything

I wanna be the rain
That falls on you
Washes away the pain
I wanna be the Sun
That shines on you
Warms your world each day
I wanna be the sky that holds the stars for you
So you never lose your way
I wanna be the wind that kisses your face
I wanna be the rain

And even in your sleep
When you're dreaming
I wanna be the only thing you see
Won't you be there in everything?

I wanna be the rain
That falls on you
Washes away the pain
I wanna be the Sun
That shines on you
Warms your world each day
I wanna be the sky that holds the stars for you
So you never lose your way
I wanna be the wind that kisses your face
I wanna be the rain
(Washes away the pain!)

I wanna be the
Rain

Rain yeah! Yeah! Yey
Rain yeah! Yeah! Yey
