See, I know what's up, papi
I'm a loca in a sexy body
I know that you wanna party
The kinda party that we both know

I can give you all my codes
Press the button and I play the role
Something far from all the shows
Es que esta chica es muy especial

Oh, oh
That's how you'd go
Oh, oh
And a little bit more
Oh, oh
If you only knew
You'd be going like, oh-oh-oh-oh

Wanna play? Come on, set the game on
I don't need no warm ups, I'm turned on
Wanna play? Take two shots and let's go
I'm waiting, so waiting
Wanna play? Come on, set the game on
Can't resist the heat, it's gettin' too strong
Wanna play? Take two shots and let's go
I'm waiting, so waiting
