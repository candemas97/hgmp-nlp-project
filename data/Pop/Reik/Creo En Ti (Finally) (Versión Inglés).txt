I might have spent my whole life waiting in the dark
Or left this place with a hole inside my heart
You came when I decided this might be my fate
Not one second early not one second late

Tell me how
You give me hope with just one kiss
And fill my doubt
With a love I can't forget

Oh, finally, I breathe again
There are no words to describe it
There's no way that I can hide it
Oh, no, finally, the fear is gone
And I don't have to face this world alone
Even though I lost my way with you, I'm finally home

There were times the pain was more than I could take
But somehow each and every scar has been erased
And if the Sun and Moon and stars come crashing down
I'll be in your arms; no safer place I found

This is more
Than a simple memory I can't ignore
My dreams
Turned into reality

Oh, finally, I breathe again
There are no words to describe it
There's no way that I can hide it
Oh, no, finally, the fear is gone
And I don't have to face this world alone
Even though I lost my way with you, I'm finally home
