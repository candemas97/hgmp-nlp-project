Sun through the shadows
Light through the door
Voice like an echo
I can't hear anymore

So I follow your steps
While the love that you left
Is burned in my heart
With dreams in my mind
Of the next time that I
Have you in my arms

'Cause I will tell you the whole truth
That there's no color in the world without you
And I finally see how your love is the best of me
Yeah there's so much I want you to know
Guess I'll wait til you're home

The way that you smile
When you think you're alone
The best gift of this life
Is to see you up close

Now and again
In the palm of my hand
I feel your touch
So I write it all down
All these moments I've found
Till I see you my love

And I will tell you the whole truth
That there's no color in the world without you
And I finally see how your love is the best of me
Yeah there's so much I want you to know
Yeah there's so much I want you to know
Guess I'll wait til you're home
